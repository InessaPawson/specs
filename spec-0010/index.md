- Indicate the type of release: minor, patch, pre-, ...

### Editing a Changelog

It is generally acceptable to edit a changelog for the following reasons:

- maintaining accuracy of the records about the changes in each release (e.g.,
  adding essential information that was left out when the initial changelog was published)
- improving clarity and readability of the change log. Try to avoid nitpicking when
  making edits to the changelog.

## Notes

<!--
Include a bulleted list of annotated links, comments,
and other ancillary information as needed.
